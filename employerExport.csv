technology, it isn’t a “silver-bullet” solution as some would suggest. Rather, we
believe real digital transformation happens when we combine AI with analytics,
automation, and a bold vision on how to apply these technologies together at
scale. That’s what the Applied Intelligence approach is all about.<br></p>
<p>We help you collect, interpret and enhance data that may have been previously
hidden or out of reach, generating near real-time insights. Our cross-
disciplinary teams of industry-specific experts use this intelligence to discover
new opportunities and reimagine your products and services, opening up
new revenue streams. At the same time, we create policies and processes that
ensure AI is responsible and benefits all parties impacted – all while ensuring
innovation isn’t hampered. And we make sure to empower and train your people
to work alongside these technologies to make faster, more informed decisions
that are less transactional and more strategic. </p>
<p>While we have proven, ready-to-
go industrialized solutions, we know that no two clients are alike. Therefore,
our team of more than 6,000 experts in AI and data science spanning over 125
countries will customize the right solutions for your needs. Our flexibility to work
with almost any technology partner also allows us to help you get the most out of
your existing analytics and AI investments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Supply Chain</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Sustainability </li>
</ol>
<p>Our Supply Chain is all about the customers. We use AI models for commodity forecasting, to build scenarios that anticipate demand and capacity and to know how much material/supply we are moving in advance for example. This provides a competitive advantage, creates favourable financial conditions and helps us better coordinate our operations.</p>
<p>From an Operations stand point, we use AI in projects such as fleet optimization & PtU (Predict the Unseen), which is helping us improve the ETA accuracy for active inbound trains, increasing the efficiency and predictability of our network.​ The machine learning model provides near real-time ETA predictions based on historical data (train delays, train characteristics, weather, historical trip information, etc). In addition, this science can support predictive maintenance of locomotives and cars, resulting in reduced repair costs.</p>
<p>Finally, within Sustainability, we leverage AI to improve safety by reducing injuries. We’ve used it to build a predictive app that assists supervisors by computing different factors including the weather, number of workers on sites, the scope of labour and more to reduce the risk of injuries.  <br><br></p>

We transform large, slow, power consumptive deep neural networks (DNNs) so they can be deployed directly within edge devices such as cameras, sensors, drones, phones, cars etc.  A significant challenge with deep learning AI models is how large they are and how processor and power intensive they can be to operate.  For this reason, many AI applications are forced to use cloud processing rather than locally run AI in the devices themselves.  Most DNN’s are simply too large and complex to be deployed to the edge so the cloud is the only option.  Not only is this not practical in certain critical applications but even when it works the cloud processing costs are massive.  Current methods to reduce the size of DNN’s requires expensive deep learning engineers and lots of time using trial and error.  Deeplite solves this problem by using a fully automated, AI engine to optimize DNN models making them smaller, faster and more efficient that can be deployed to any hardware platform.  With Deeplite, AI can break free from the cloud, unlocking the potential to use intelligence in devices we use every day and changing the way we live.</p>",4165188956,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/employers/942848-deeplite-inc,http://www.deeplite.ai,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/uploads/employer/logo/942848/deeplite-logo-240x160.jpg,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/uploads/employer/hero/942848/2021-06-11_10.02.45.jpg,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rOPLccQkZ6kjzrwyJLuTg,"Toronto, ON, Canada",100 Simcoe St. Suite 115,Toronto,Ontario,,Canada,2021-10-08 18:27:21 UTC,0,,Yes,Technology (Information and Media),SME Organization

We believe in patient-centred care and in health equity. And we believe in learning from the many diverse communities that make up Ontario, so we can reflect those learnings in everything we do. Our highly skilled team comes from across the province and collectively applies world class experience, knowledge and expertise to support health care professionals and to benefit all Ontarians.</p>
<p>We oversee health care delivery across the province, which includes ensuring front-line providers and other health professionals have the tools and information they need to deliver the best possible care within their communities. This also means simplifying the current system and connecting and coordinating its many complex parts in new and innovative ways. This involves keeping a close eye on how the health system is performing and providing evidence-based standards and improvements to address any gaps. And all the while, we are taking a “digital first” approach to health care – such as enabling virtual care and putting systems in place so Ontarians can access their own health records and securely share them within their circles of care.</p>
<p>Through integration, coordination, connection and clinical excellence, we are working to reduce strain on the system which will enable us to invest more resources on the care Ontarians need, and, most importantly, improve health outcomes and overall wellness for all.</p>",,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/employers/732755-ontario-health,http://www.ontariohealth.ca,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/uploads/employer/logo/732755/OH_Bil_Pos_RGB.jpg,,,,"Toronto, ON, Canada",525 University Avenue,Toronto,Ontario,,Canada,2021-03-29 14:16:30 UTC,0,,Yes,Health,Health Partner

Scoliosis is the most prevalent spine deformity found in children and is defined as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine. SeeSpine comprises a point of care mobile application and an optional patient administration web portal for clinicians. The mobile application employs any smartphone's camera to recreate a scaled three-dimensional model of the torso from a simple video. The video can be taken remotely, at home, most often, by the child's parents. SeeSpine's proprietary software then quantifies the extra-spinal deformities (what we see) and correlates them to the spinal curvature (what we can only see on X-Rays) to predict a Cobb-Angle (degrees of curvature). The scans and subsequent Cobb-Angles can then be securely and remotely sent to the patients treating physician to guide clinical decision-making. SeeSpine’s mobile application can also be used to screen patients for indications of a spinal deformity and provide a suggestion as to whether contacting a physician is necessary. Patients benefit from SeeSpine’s radiation-free technology via more frequent progression tracking, quicker treatment adjustments and decreased hospital visits. The physician portal allows them to track their patients remotely, adjust visit schedules and adapt treatment plans sooner.</p>

</p>
<p>Uber ATG is developing self-driving technologies that advance Uber’s mission of bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere. Our team in Toronto is home to our Research & Development group that focuses on solving complex problems within self-driving. </p>
<p>AI enables our systems to perceive the surrounding environment using multiple sensors, predict the motion and intent of actors in the near future, and plan safe maneuvers for the self-driving vehicle. Learning what and how to simulate is a focus of interest for our researchers at ATG. As all the modules mentioned above are powered by AI, topics related to generative models, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, deep structured models, network architectural search, model compression, learning in the presence of noisy and unstructured data, and other exciting research areas are very actively pursued by our team.</p>
<p>At Uber, we believe that building best-in-class self-driving technology will take time, and safety is our priority every step of the way. Operating inclusively and transparently, while displaying responsible behaviour in a structured development are critical to safety. We at ATG seek candidates who will role model these values. We are a group of diverse researchers, engineers, and computer scientists working to develop perception algorithms for self-driving vehicles. Reliability and scalability are key drivers for us as our software must perform across a large fleet of vehicles in large and diverse operating areas.</p>

d400ca4b-7942-4e0f-bd90-5f514ea7e067,hrweb@uhn.ca,University Health Network,"<p>University Health Network (UHN) is Canada's largest research hospital. With campuses across the GTA, including four hospital sites and various other research facilities, UHN undertakes the full spectrum of medical science. This research spans from basic and fundamental discovery research to applied and clinical research—work that is conducted by more than 1,000 scientists at seven research institutes.  </p>
<p>As technologies such as whole genome sequencing, advanced medical imaging and remote population health monitoring become more common, the need to analyze vast amounts of data permeates almost all areas of medical research. AI and machine learning are meeting these needs and emerging as key tools to advance medical discovery, education and practice.  </p>
<p>The ways in which these tools are used by UHN researchers reflect our broad areas of research. They are being applied to unravel new molecular therapies that can be tailored to individual patients; to dramatically improve the efficiency and speed of the delivery of patient care by fast-tracking radiation treatment plans; to enable patients to age gracefully by bringing health care into the home through remote health monitoring and robotics-assisted rehabilitation; and to analyze the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 to shed light on new emerging variants of concern and gain insights into their origins, evolution and virulence. These are just a few examples of the ways in which our world-class research teams are leveraging AI technology to improve human health and wellbeing.</p>

Digitizing production to better manage crop loads could help growers intervene early, increasing marketable yield, sustainability, and the amount of food produced on existing acreage.  In permanent and specialty crops, the non-homogenous production environments and barrier of leaf canopies for aerial data collection have prevented data collection at scale, until now.</p>
