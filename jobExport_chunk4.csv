<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>Given the large size of market data, data analytics (e.g., using advanced techniques such as machine learning) are needed to provide business insights. In addition, having an intelligent data visualization platform would bring the analytical presentation to the next level. As a result, GRA is developing a Dashboard web application for this purpose. This web application would serve as a centralized platform to host various data analytics dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further, due to increasing importance of assessing the impacts of climate change to financial institutions, GRA is also building expertise in climate risk analytics to support RBC’s various climate risk stress testing and scenario analysis mandates (e.g., CCAR in US, ICAAP in UK). In particular, GRA has the model development ownership for several regional climate risk scenario analysis models, covering both transition risk (posed to clients in transition to low-carbon economy) and physical risk (posed by acute weather events) for different asset classes (e.g., corporate bond, municipal bonds, real estate, and wholesale loans). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Climate analytics is an emerging field. Institutions around the world (e.g., regulators, banks, vendors, etc.) are grappling with the challenges in how to enhance the data, scenario design, and methodology. At this stage, GRA is currently developing a unified platform to onboard different “climate risk + machine learning” modules, and potentially utilizing open-source data (if deemed appropriate) for research purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GRA is seeking an individual who is interested in applying data analytics (including machine learning) and programming skills to empower our climate risk analytics capability. The intern student will be involved in researching open-source data platforms for climate risk, and developing Python-based tools for climate risk related analytics and machine learning applications. The candidate will learn data analytics and machine learning with applications in climate risk.</p>

Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>

<h2>About you</h2>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>
<li>Bring critical thought and opinion</li>
<li>Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward</li>
<li>Work digital-first for your daily work</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Our product is designed to empower entrepreneurs. Consequently, the work you do will not only create value for our users but also contribute to global entrepreneurship. To thrive here, you need to be dedicated to your craft and committed to constant development. You should be an independent thinker who can solve complex problems and handle a bit of chaos without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Senior Data Scientist</strong>, you will partner with Product, Engineering, UX, and other disciplines to lead through data and achieve product/business goals. Product Data Scientists are expected to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Proactively identify and champion projects that solve complex problems in important business areas. </li>
<li>Partner closely with product, engineering and other business leaders to influence product and program decisions with data</li>
<li>Holistically own general problems in those product/business domains and understand how those problems/domains interact with the rest of Shopify.</li>
<li>Build actionable KPIs, production-quality dashboards, informative deep dives, and scalable data products</li>
<li>Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when appropriate) to inform improvements to our business</li>
<li>Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders, especially data engineering, to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas  that support business processes</li>
<li>Influence leadership to drive more data-informed decisions</li>
<li>Define and advance best practices within your data science and product teams</li>

These all come together to help merchant’s meet their diverse needs. A shoe brand in Canada, a small jeweler in Japan, and a Fortune 500 company in Germany all need different tools so succeed! This Data Science team is focused on helping merchants make the most use of these different features and apps all over the world.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Checkout & Storefront</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Core Product Data Science team combines leading-edge analytical techniques with strong business & product acumen in order to drive better decisions and outcomes for Shopify’s merchants.

<p><strong><em>Executive Insights</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Executive Insights team supports Shopify leadership in setting the direction of the company, sharing our message of entrepreneurship to the world, and investing in building the best products for our merchants. We do this by combining a deep understanding of the entrepreneurs that use our products, our position in the marketplace and the challenges our merchants face.</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>
<li>Bring critical thought and opinion</li>
<li>Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward</li>
<li>Work digital-first for your daily work</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to build state of the art merchant- and buyer- facing products powered by ML.<br></p>
<p>As an Applied Machine Learning expert at Shopify, you'll be at the forefront of training and deploying ML systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. Shopify is in a unique position to build state of the art ML systems the way they should be built with the resources of a world class e-commerce leader. The number of applications for ML systems at Shopify is vast. There are many different product lines looking for Applied ML Experts</p>
<p>Areas where you can contribute your ML expertise include:</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to hire someone who can provide technical leadership as we use generative AI to create purpose-built solutions for entrepreneurs. We recently announced Sidekick (<a href=""https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Tobi, our CEO describes it best)</u></a> which is a perfect example of how AI can help our merchants succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Working on our direct to consumer app (<a href=""https://shop.app/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Shop</u></a>), the goal is to create more value for buyers and merchants. This role is focused on building the next generation of search, discovery, trust and personalization algorithms, incorporating and evolving the state of the art techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Search & Product Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Shopify storefront is the front end of a Shopify store that customers interact with. It is the public-facing part of the store where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout.  Work on this team focuses on helping connect buyers to products that they are interested in through the development of online discovery, search, recommendation, conversion optimization, and ranking systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple statistical techniques, we are helping merchants allocate budgets more effectively, target specific audiences with personalized ads, and achieve improved results in terms of ROI and ad performance. More in general, we are building data products that improve the ability of our merchants to do effective advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
<p>Shopify is building a financial services suite to power the Shopify economy and to meet our merchants financial needs.  As part of this initiative, we are creating proprietary machine learning algorithms to enhance underwriting capabilities for lending products like Shopify Capital and Shopify Credit. Additionally, these algorithms will bolster fraud detection and mitigation capabilities for Shopify Balance, Bill Pay, and overall risk management for our range of products and services. This work involves redefining merchant engagement with financial tools, guiding the development of machine learning models and features that will drive the next generation of financial products offered by Shopify.</p>
<p>If any of the above areas appeal we’d love to hear from you.  </p>
<p>Key outputs</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing, deploying and maintaining end-to-end machine learning systems at scale</li>
<li>Producing system design and architecture of scalable AI/ML systems</li>
<li>Designing and implementing robust data pipelines for training models and fine-tuning LLMs</li>
<li>Solving high impact data problems and delivering business impact through data and machine learning products</li>
<li>Prioritizing and communicating to technical and non-technical audiences alike</li>
<li>Mentoring senior data scientists</li>

<p>GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, NVIDIA's GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain - two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.”</p>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. </p> <p> This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>

<p><strong><br>Our Engineering Internships are open to current university students, recent grads, self-taught learners, and career changers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Engineering Internships are 4 month long, full-time, paid experiences. For our Fall 2024 cohort, we are looking for students that can join us from September 3rd - December 20th, 2024.

<p>You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100. </p>
<p>Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Path’s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold. </p>
<p><strong>The Path equations are as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AB</strong>: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AC</strong>: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BC</strong>: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BD</strong>: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>CD</strong>: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible. </p>
<p>Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.</p>
