<span class=""block font-normal text-sm mb-2"">Please answer the question below<span class=""text-red-600 ml-1 font-normal"">*</span></span><div class=""text-xs richtext"">
<p>You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100. </p>
<p>Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Path’s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold. </p>
<p><strong>The Path equations are as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AB</strong>: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AC</strong>: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BC</strong>: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BD</strong>: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>CD</strong>: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible. </p>
<p>Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.</p>
