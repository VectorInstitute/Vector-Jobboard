<p> </p>
<p>The world is changing faster than ever and so are we! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Big data</em>”, “<em>machine learning</em>” and “<em>AI</em>” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality. </p>
<p>Our goal is to be nothing less than <em>The Leading Bank in The Americas</em> by putting <em>Customers First.</em> Achieving this requires a <em>Winning Team</em> that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You'll do in this Role?</strong></p>
<p>As a Manager, you will report directly to a Senior Manager or Director and be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and supporting analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – the risk decisioning models used by 2 or more of the bank’s retail and small business product lines, across the entire customer lifecycle. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Operations, Product, Risk Strategy & Risk Management, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Legal, Compliance and Audit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your team will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on-premise GPU computing, open source Jupyter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the guidance of your Director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction models that will be used potentially millions of times, every year and therefore need to be not only accurate and precise, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals & priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is This Role Right for You?</strong></p>
<ul> <li>You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way</li> <li>You are both deeply curious and highly pragmatic</li> <li>You are comfortable with ambitious but realistic goals and are committed to achieving them</li> <li>You are social, engaging, not afraid to ask questions and relish the opportunity to learn from business partners (the majority of whom will be far less technical than you)</li> <li>You relish the implication and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that every single time your model is used, it impacts a real human being</li> <li>You understand the difference between accuracy and precision and get excited by really great KS values and ROC curves</li> <li>You have a genuine love, passion and talent for programming, data, and predictive modeling</li> <li>You are comfortable initiating conversations and collaborating with diverse personalities</li> <li>You are committed to quality in everything you do – statistically, process and governance wise</li> <li>You look forward to sharing your insights with your peers through high-quality effective verbal and written communications</li> <li>You are professional, motivated AND FUN. We mean it.<br>	 </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sample projects that you might work on include:</em></p>
<ul> <li>Complete specialized analysis, develop creative statistical solutions and recommend improvements to estimation techniques, risk rating systems and/or internal or vendor-developed credit risk models</li> <li>Collaborate with risk management teams, external vendors, technology, and country risk counterparts as well as other stakeholders (i.e. audit, product) to ensure consistent and effective governance, measurement and communication of models / scorecards and their performance</li> <li>Conduct research of new innovative modeling methodologies, tools and regulatory requirements; develop new methodologies for model development, monitoring and reporting</li> <li>Lead the periodic review and maintenance of credit risk models / scorecards</li> <li>Identify, promote and lead process improvements for model development and monitoring</li> <li>Ensure that the data used for model development is reliable and robust and that it adheres to industry and regulatory standards </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Are We Looking For?</strong></p>
<p>We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways.  We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about <em>everything</em> (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability. </p>
<p>To be a Manager in Retail Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with customers across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important. </p>
<p>We are results driven, we work hard, we play hard, we nerd out and we bring service, smiles and solutions to every problem that we face; so should you.<strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have the skills that will enable you to succeed in this role?</strong></p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<li><p><strong>Relationship Building </strong>– Develop and maintain excellent relationships with various groups across Capital Markets Risk Management, Capital Markets, Technology and Finance as most of the issues identified through model performance monitoring require collaborative effort among multiple teams to resolve.

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p><strong>What is the opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>Global Risk Analytics (GRA) is the center of expertise for models used in risk management. This includes risk analytics for market risk, counterparty credit risk and emerging risk. GRA’s analytics innovation team focuses on emerging risks, including machine learning and climate analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the large size of market data, data analytics (e.g., using advanced techniques such as machine learning) are needed to provide business insights. In addition, having an intelligent data visualization platform would bring the analytical presentation to the next level. As a result, GRA is developing a Dashboard web application for this purpose. This web application would serve as a centralized platform to host various data analytics dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further, due to increasing importance of assessing the impacts of climate change to financial institutions, GRA is also building expertise in climate risk analytics to support RBC’s various climate risk stress testing and scenario analysis mandates (e.g., CCAR in US, ICAAP in UK). In particular, GRA has the model development ownership for several regional climate risk scenario analysis models, covering both transition risk (posed to clients in transition to low-carbon economy) and physical risk (posed by acute weather events) for different asset classes (e.g., corporate bond, municipal bonds, real estate, and wholesale loans). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Climate analytics is an emerging field. Institutions around the world (e.g., regulators, banks, vendors, etc.) are grappling with the challenges in how to enhance the data, scenario design, and methodology. At this stage, GRA is currently developing a unified platform to onboard different “climate risk + machine learning” modules, and potentially utilizing open-source data (if deemed appropriate) for research purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GRA is seeking an individual who is interested in applying data analytics (including machine learning) and programming skills to empower our climate risk analytics capability. The intern student will be involved in researching open-source data platforms for climate risk, and developing Python-based tools for climate risk related analytics and machine learning applications. The candidate will learn data analytics and machine learning with applications in climate risk.</p>

<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Who are we?</b></div>
<div>We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learns to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We've recently raised our <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://txt.cohere.com/announcement/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Series C</a>, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">“Attention is all you need”</a>, and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Why this role? </b></div>
<div>At Cohere, we strive to continually improve our large language models. Academic research and real-world experience has demonstrated that high quality, diverse datasets can contribute as much to the performance and capabilities of LLMs as the underlying model architecture and training regimen. We at Cohere believe data will play a central role in accelerating the advancement of our already world-class language models.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Data is therefore critical to our success. Our ability to acquire data that is accurate, relevant, and timely is key to our ability to improve the quality of our models. We strive to continuously improve our data acquisition processes and systems to ensure that we have the data we need to stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers. We run frequent experiments to learn more about the role of data for model quality, from data mixtures, to cleaning techniques, to quality control.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This role will be part of the Data Acquisition team, which broadly provides data for training models and is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that acquires, cleans, and formats data for model training. We are looking for a technically skilled, resourceful problem-solver who is able to work in areas of ambiguity and find efficient and sometimes creative solutions. The main responsibility of this role is to improve our internal data acquisition infrastructure, which includes data crawlers, formatters, and integrations with data providers. This role would also work closely with different teams at Cohere to support their data acquisition needs, as well as engage in more experimental work to develop highly informative data signals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<b>Please Note</b>: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.</div>
</div><div class=""section page-centered""><div>

<li>You have experience building data pipelines and ETL processes for large-scale datasets</li>
<li>You have experience working with unstructured and/or human-annotated data (e.g., collecting or assessing sample quality).</li>
<li>You have experience with ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR</li>
<li>You have strong communication and problem-solving skills, preferring the right tool for the job even if it’s outside your wheelhouse</li>
<li>You feel comfortable actively reading academic literature and researching state-of-the-art NLP best practices.</li>
<li>You have a demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products</li>
</ul></ul>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As the Senior Quantitative Analyst, Risk Model Performance & Analytics, you will be responsible for CIBC’s Initial Margin Model and monitoring of the adequacy of the model as well as the accurate risk capture of Initial Margin under ISDA SIMM v2.5. You will have frequent interaction with CIBC and client’s collateral teams through this process. You will be responsible for ongoing enhancement of the model as new versions are released.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, you will be responsible for creating and streamlining analysis and reporting processes through automation and creation of tools for more effective and proactive risk management. You will work closely with our colleagues within Risk and our Technology partners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>You’ll have the flexibility to manage your work activities within a hybrid work arrangement where you’ll spend 1-3 days per week on-site, while other days will be remote.</em></p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Succeed</strong></p>
<ul>

Develop expertise in CMRM and Capital Markets systems, processes and underlying models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relationship Building </strong>– Develop and maintain excellent relationships with various groups across Capital Markets Risk Management, Capital Markets, Technology and Finance as most of the issues identified through model performance monitoring require collaborative effort among multiple teams to resolve.

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>Invision AI offers deep expertise with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the intelligent infrastructure and transportation space. We have developed a number of unique technical innovations incorporated into a central AI platform. We go beyond simple 2D detection by capturing details about the space in 3D, including volume, direction, position and speed.

<p>As a company, we distinguish ourselves by taking an integrated hardware-software approach throughout all our products as we constantly iterate between sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar), their geometries and the associated vision and artificial intelligence algorithms. This has consistently allowed us to achieve industry-leading accuracy and reliability. We build lightweight, cost-effective, edge solutions: we locate compute nodes close to the sensors (as opposed to in the cloud) and leverage distributed compute and wireless transmission where needed. </p>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business.

Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>

<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Who are we?</b></div>
<div>We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learns to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We've recently raised our <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://txt.cohere.com/announcement/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Series C</a>, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">“Attention is all you need”</a>, and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Why this role? </b></div>
<div>At Cohere, we strive to continually improve our large language models. Academic research and real-world experience has demonstrated that high quality, diverse datasets can contribute as much to the performance and capabilities of LLMs as the underlying model architecture and training regimen. We at Cohere believe data will play a central role in accelerating the advancement of our already world-class language models.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Data is therefore critical to our success. Our ability to acquire data that is accurate, relevant, and timely is key to our ability to improve the quality of our models. We strive to continuously improve our data acquisition processes and systems to ensure that we have the data we need to stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers. We run frequent experiments to learn more about the role of data for model quality, from data mixtures, to cleaning techniques, to quality control.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This role will be part of the Data Acquisition team, which broadly provides data for training models and is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that acquires, cleans, and formats data for model training. We are looking for a technically skilled, resourceful problem-solver who is able to work in areas of ambiguity and find efficient and sometimes creative solutions. The main responsibility of this role is to improve our internal data acquisition infrastructure, which includes data crawlers, formatters, and integrations with data providers. This role would also work closely with different teams at Cohere to support their data acquisition needs, as well as engage in more experimental work to develop highly informative data signals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>

<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to build state of the art merchant- and buyer- facing products powered by ML.<br></p>
<p>As an Applied Machine Learning expert at Shopify, you'll be at the forefront of training and deploying ML systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. Shopify is in a unique position to build state of the art ML systems the way they should be built with the resources of a world class e-commerce leader. The number of applications for ML systems at Shopify is vast. There are many different product lines looking for Applied ML Experts</p>
<p>Areas where you can contribute your ML expertise include:</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to hire someone who can provide technical leadership as we use generative AI to create purpose-built solutions for entrepreneurs. We recently announced Sidekick (<a href=""https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Tobi, our CEO describes it best)</u></a> which is a perfect example of how AI can help our merchants succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Working on our direct to consumer app (<a href=""https://shop.app/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Shop</u></a>), the goal is to create more value for buyers and merchants. This role is focused on building the next generation of search, discovery, trust and personalization algorithms, incorporating and evolving the state of the art techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Search & Product Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Shopify storefront is the front end of a Shopify store that customers interact with. It is the public-facing part of the store where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout.  Work on this team focuses on helping connect buyers to products that they are interested in through the development of online discovery, search, recommendation, conversion optimization, and ranking systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple statistical techniques, we are helping merchants allocate budgets more effectively, target specific audiences with personalized ads, and achieve improved results in terms of ROI and ad performance. More in general, we are building data products that improve the ability of our merchants to do effective advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
<p>Shopify is building a financial services suite to power the Shopify economy and to meet our merchants financial needs.  As part of this initiative, we are creating proprietary machine learning algorithms to enhance underwriting capabilities for lending products like Shopify Capital and Shopify Credit. Additionally, these algorithms will bolster fraud detection and mitigation capabilities for Shopify Balance, Bill Pay, and overall risk management for our range of products and services. This work involves redefining merchant engagement with financial tools, guiding the development of machine learning models and features that will drive the next generation of financial products offered by Shopify.</p>
<p>If any of the above areas appeal we’d love to hear from you.  </p>
<p>Key outputs</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing, deploying and maintaining end-to-end machine learning systems at scale</li>
<li>Producing system design and architecture of scalable AI/ML systems</li>
<li>Designing and implementing robust data pipelines for training models and fine-tuning LLMs</li>
<li>Solving high impact data problems and delivering business impact through data and machine learning products</li>
<li>Prioritizing and communicating to technical and non-technical audiences alike</li>
<li>Mentoring senior data scientists</li>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to build state of the art merchant- and buyer- facing products powered by ML.<br></p>
<p>As an Applied Machine Learning expert at Shopify, you'll be at the forefront of training and deploying ML systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. Shopify is in a unique position to build state of the art ML systems the way they should be built with the resources of a world class e-commerce leader. The number of applications for ML systems at Shopify is vast. There are many different product lines looking for Applied ML Experts</p>
<p>Areas where you can contribute your ML expertise include:</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to hire someone who can provide technical leadership as we use generative AI to create purpose-built solutions for entrepreneurs. We recently announced Sidekick (<a href=""https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Tobi, our CEO describes it best)</u></a> which is a perfect example of how AI can help our merchants succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Working on our direct to consumer app (<a href=""https://shop.app/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Shop</u></a>), the goal is to create more value for buyers and merchants. This role is focused on building the next generation of search, discovery, trust and personalization algorithms, incorporating and evolving the state of the art techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Search & Product Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Shopify storefront is the front end of a Shopify store that customers interact with. It is the public-facing part of the store where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout.  Work on this team focuses on helping connect buyers to products that they are interested in through the development of online discovery, search, recommendation, conversion optimization, and ranking systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple statistical techniques, we are helping merchants allocate budgets more effectively, target specific audiences with personalized ads, and achieve improved results in terms of ROI and ad performance. More in general, we are building data products that improve the ability of our merchants to do effective advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
<p>Shopify is building a financial services suite to power the Shopify economy and to meet our merchants financial needs.  As part of this initiative, we are creating proprietary machine learning algorithms to enhance underwriting capabilities for lending products like Shopify Capital and Shopify Credit. Additionally, these algorithms will bolster fraud detection and mitigation capabilities for Shopify Balance, Bill Pay, and overall risk management for our range of products and services. This work involves redefining merchant engagement with financial tools, guiding the development of machine learning models and features that will drive the next generation of financial products offered by Shopify.</p>
<p>If any of the above areas appeal we’d love to hear from you.  </p>
<p>Key outputs</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing, deploying and maintaining end-to-end machine learning systems at scale</li>
<li>Producing system design and architecture of scalable AI/ML systems</li>
<li>Designing and implementing robust data pipelines for training models and fine-tuning LLMs</li>
<li>Solving high impact data problems and delivering business impact through data and machine learning products</li>
<li>Prioritizing and communicating to technical and non-technical audiences alike</li>
<li>Mentoring senior data scientists</li>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. </p> <p> This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>

<p>You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100. </p>
<p>Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Path’s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold. </p>
<p><strong>The Path equations are as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AB</strong>: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AC</strong>: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BC</strong>: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BD</strong>: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>CD</strong>: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible. </p>
<p>Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.</p>

<div class=""md:text-lg max-w-[676px] text-base space-y-4""><div class=""richtext"">
<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business.

Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. </p> <p> This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
