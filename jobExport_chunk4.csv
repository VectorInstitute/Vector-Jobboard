<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

Working with customers across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Overview:</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">“Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>What Are We Looking For?</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented leaders who are equally at home amongst neural networks as they are translating complex issues into concise communications and directions. We want advanced analysts / data scientists who come armed with not only strong statistical, programming and data engineering skills but also a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right the first time and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">To be a Director in Retail and Small Business Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you have to want to be an owner who embraces both the accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”) and responsibilities that come with ownership. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs (for accurate optimized forecasts) and questions (qualitative and analytic alike) into outcomes and answers, exploring both novel and legacy data sets / methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that you “own” will all be equally important. The types of Directors we are looking for are player-coaches (an interest in teaching & mentoring is essential!) who relish the idea of running their own “model factory” and everything that comes with it.</span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Make an Impact</b></span></span><br> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">As a director, you will report directly to the VP of Retail and Small Business Models and Analytics and be a critical member of the global leadership team. You will be accountable for – from conception through execution and governance – the capital estimation, optimization and forecasting models covering The Bank’s retail and small business product lines. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Operations, Capital Management, Provisioning, Product, Risk Strategy & Risk Management, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Legal, Compliance and Audit.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>

<h2>About the job</h2>
<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>Invision AI offers deep expertise with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the intelligent infrastructure and transportation space.

This has consistently allowed us to achieve industry-leading accuracy and reliability. We build lightweight, cost-effective, edge solutions: we locate compute nodes close to the sensors (as opposed to in the cloud) and leverage distributed compute and wireless transmission where needed. </p>

6766d130-6e20-4fc5-81fd-be322566d624,316500511,Shopify Inc.,"Senior Product Data Scientist, Multiple Roles",full,Canada,2024-04-05T20:27:33.115Z,"<h2>About Shopify</h2>
<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>
<li>Bring critical thought and opinion</li>
<li>Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward</li>
<li>Work digital-first for your daily work</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>As a Product Analytics professional, you'll be tasked with transforming raw data into actionable insights that will help guide the development and improvement of our products. This role isn't for the faint-hearted or those seeking a conventional corporate structure - we operate on the principles of low process, high trust, and high impact. It's all about getting things done quickly and efficiently, while continuously learning and adapting to changes in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Our product is designed to empower entrepreneurs. Consequently, the work you do will not only create value for our users but also contribute to global entrepreneurship. To thrive here, you need to be dedicated to your craft and committed to constant development. You should be an independent thinker who can solve complex problems and handle a bit of chaos without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Senior Data Scientist</strong>, you will partner with Product, Engineering, UX, and other disciplines to lead through data and achieve product/business goals. Product Data Scientists are expected to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Proactively identify and champion projects that solve complex problems in important business areas. </li>
<li>Partner closely with product, engineering and other business leaders to influence product and program decisions with data</li>
<li>Holistically own general problems in those product/business domains and understand how those problems/domains interact with the rest of Shopify.</li>
<li>Build actionable KPIs, production-quality dashboards, informative deep dives, and scalable data products</li>
<li>Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when appropriate) to inform improvements to our business</li>
<li>Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders, especially data engineering, to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas  that support business processes</li>
<li>Influence leadership to drive more data-informed decisions</li>
<li>Define and advance best practices within your data science and product teams</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several teams looking for Product Data Scientists to partner with and help drive value for our merchants. These include:</p>
<p><strong><em>Core Ecosystem, International, and Marketing</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Merchants use Shopify in a variety of ways, using a wide array of first-party features and augmenting them with third-party apps. These all come together to help merchant’s meet their diverse needs. A shoe brand in Canada, a small jeweler in Japan, and a Fortune 500 company in Germany all need different tools so succeed! This Data Science team is focused on helping merchants make the most use of these different features and apps all over the world.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Checkout & Storefront</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Core Product Data Science team combines leading-edge analytical techniques with strong business & product acumen in order to drive better decisions and outcomes for Shopify’s merchants. Data Scientists turn data into actionable insights through a number of analytical methods, such as A/B tests, In-depth studies, advanced modeling, data visualizations, etc. to shape and support our product development strategies. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Executive Insights</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Executive Insights team supports Shopify leadership in setting the direction of the company, sharing our message of entrepreneurship to the world, and investing in building the best products for our merchants. We do this by combining a deep understanding of the entrepreneurs that use our products, our position in the marketplace and the challenges our merchants face.</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Extensive experience in product analytics, experimentation, metrics research, and working with engineers on instrumentation and robust data pipelining</li>
<li>Extensive experience in a data science role solving large-scale, high impact business problems</li>
<li>Masterful data storytelling and strategic thinking, with an ability to inspire and cultivate the Data culture within your team</li>
<li>Extensive experience using Python including a strong grasp of object oriented programming (OOP) fundamentals</li>
<li>Deep understanding of advanced SQL techniques and data modeling </li>
<li>Well versed with various Business Intelligence platforms and tools</li>
<li>Experience working with various levels of business stakeholders, from c-suite to engineering and product development teams.</li>
<li>Working on multiple work streams excites you, and you are able to use ambiguity as an opportunity for high-level thinking</li>
<li>Experience creating data product strategies, building data products, and continued iteration after launch</li>
<li>Experience launching productionized machine learning models at scale is a plus</li>
<li>Extensive domain experience in e-commerce, sales & marketing or SaaS is a plus</li>

<div>We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learns to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We've recently raised our <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://txt.cohere.com/announcement/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Series C</a>, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">“Attention is all you need”</a>, and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Why this role? </b></div>
<div>At Cohere, we strive to continually improve our large language models. Academic research and real-world experience has demonstrated that high quality, diverse datasets can contribute as much to the performance and capabilities of LLMs as the underlying model architecture and training regimen. We at Cohere believe data will play a central role in accelerating the advancement of our already world-class language models.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Data is therefore critical to our success. Our ability to acquire data that is accurate, relevant, and timely is key to our ability to improve the quality of our models. We strive to continuously improve our data acquisition processes and systems to ensure that we have the data we need to stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers. We run frequent experiments to learn more about the role of data for model quality, from data mixtures, to cleaning techniques, to quality control.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This role will be part of the Data Acquisition team, which broadly provides data for training models and is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that acquires, cleans, and formats data for model training. We are looking for a technically skilled, resourceful problem-solver who is able to work in areas of ambiguity and find efficient and sometimes creative solutions. The main responsibility of this role is to improve our internal data acquisition infrastructure, which includes data crawlers, formatters, and integrations with data providers. This role would also work closely with different teams at Cohere to support their data acquisition needs, as well as engage in more experimental work to develop highly informative data signals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<b>Please Note</b>: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.</div>

<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to build state of the art merchant- and buyer- facing products powered by ML.<br></p>
<p>As an Applied Machine Learning expert at Shopify, you'll be at the forefront of training and deploying ML systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. Shopify is in a unique position to build state of the art ML systems the way they should be built with the resources of a world class e-commerce leader.

<p>Areas where you can contribute your ML expertise include:</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to hire someone who can provide technical leadership as we use generative AI to create purpose-built solutions for entrepreneurs. We recently announced Sidekick (<a href=""https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Tobi, our CEO describes it best)</u></a> which is a perfect example of how AI can help our merchants succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Working on our direct to consumer app (<a href=""https://shop.app/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Shop</u></a>), the goal is to create more value for buyers and merchants. This role is focused on building the next generation of search, discovery, trust and personalization algorithms, incorporating and evolving the state of the art techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Search & Product Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Shopify storefront is the front end of a Shopify store that customers interact with. It is the public-facing part of the store where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout.  Work on this team focuses on helping connect buyers to products that they are interested in through the development of online discovery, search, recommendation, conversion optimization, and ranking systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple statistical techniques, we are helping merchants allocate budgets more effectively, target specific audiences with personalized ads, and achieve improved results in terms of ROI and ad performance. More in general, we are building data products that improve the ability of our merchants to do effective advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
<p>Shopify is building a financial services suite to power the Shopify economy and to meet our merchants financial needs.  As part of this initiative, we are creating proprietary machine learning algorithms to enhance underwriting capabilities for lending products like Shopify Capital and Shopify Credit. Additionally, these algorithms will bolster fraud detection and mitigation capabilities for Shopify Balance, Bill Pay, and overall risk management for our range of products and services. This work involves redefining merchant engagement with financial tools, guiding the development of machine learning models and features that will drive the next generation of financial products offered by Shopify.</p>
<p>If any of the above areas appeal we’d love to hear from you.  </p>

<div class=""md:text-lg max-w-[676px] text-base space-y-4""><div class=""richtext"">
<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. </p> <p> This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>

<p>You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100. </p>
<p>Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Path’s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold. </p>
<p><strong>The Path equations are as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AB</strong>: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AC</strong>: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BC</strong>: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BD</strong>: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>CD</strong>: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible. </p>
<p>Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.</p>
