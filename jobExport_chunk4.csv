Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Overview:</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">“Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>What Are We Looking For?</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented leaders who are equally at home amongst neural networks as they are translating complex issues into concise communications and directions. We want advanced analysts / data scientists who come armed with not only strong statistical, programming and data engineering skills but also a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right the first time and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">To be a Director in Retail and Small Business Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you have to want to be an owner who embraces both the accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”) and responsibilities that come with ownership. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs (for accurate optimized forecasts) and questions (qualitative and analytic alike) into outcomes and answers, exploring both novel and legacy data sets / methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that you “own” will all be equally important. The types of Directors we are looking for are player-coaches (an interest in teaching & mentoring is essential!) who relish the idea of running their own “model factory” and everything that comes with it.</span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Make an Impact</b></span></span><br> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">As a director, you will report directly to the VP of Retail and Small Business Models and Analytics and be a critical member of the global leadership team. You will be accountable for – from conception through execution and governance – the capital estimation, optimization and forecasting models covering The Bank’s retail and small business product lines. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Operations, Capital Management, Provisioning, Product, Risk Strategy & Risk Management, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Legal, Compliance and Audit.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>

<h2>About the job</h2>
<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>
<li>Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change</li>
<li>Bring critical thought and opinion</li>
<li>Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward</li>
<li>Work digital-first for your daily work</li>
</ul>

It's all about getting things done quickly and efficiently, while continuously learning and adapting to changes in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Our product is designed to empower entrepreneurs and stimulate personal growth. Consequently, the work you do will not only create value for our users but also contribute to global entrepreneurship. To thrive here, you need to be dedicated to your craft and committed to constant development. You should be an independent thinker who can solve complex problems and handle a bit of chaos without breaking a sweat.</p>

<li>Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when appropriate) to directly drive substantial improvements to our business</li>
<li>Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders, especially data engineering, to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas  that support business processes.</li>

<p>Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.</p>
<p>This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.</p>

<h2>About you</h2>
<p>Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.</p>
<p>Before you apply, consider if you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone</li>
<li>Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth</li>
<li>Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)</li>

<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to build state of the art merchant- and buyer- facing products powered by ML.<br></p>
<p>As an Applied Machine Learning expert at Shopify, you'll be at the forefront of training and deploying ML systems at scale, directly empowering our merchants. Shopify is in a unique position to build state of the art ML systems the way they should be built with the resources of a world class e-commerce leader. The number of applications for ML systems at Shopify is vast. There are many different product lines looking for Applied ML Experts</p>
<p>Areas where you can contribute your ML expertise include:</p>
<p><strong>Sidekick</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to hire someone who can provide technical leadership as we use generative AI to create purpose-built solutions for entrepreneurs. We recently announced Sidekick (<a href=""https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Tobi, our CEO describes it best)</u></a> which is a perfect example of how AI can help our merchants succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Working on our direct to consumer app (<a href=""https://shop.app/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow""><u>Shop</u></a>), the goal is to create more value for buyers and merchants. This role is focused on building the next generation of search, discovery, trust and personalization algorithms, incorporating and evolving the state of the art techniques. </p>
<p><strong>Search & Product Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Shopify storefront is the front end of a Shopify store that customers interact with. It is the public-facing part of the store where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout.  Work on this team focuses on helping connect buyers to products that they are interested in through the development of online discovery, search, recommendation, conversion optimization, and ranking systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
<p>Leveraging multiple statistical techniques, we are helping merchants allocate budgets more effectively, target specific audiences with personalized ads, and achieve improved results in terms of ROI and ad performance. More in general, we are building data products that improve the ability of our merchants to do effective advertising.  </p>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
<p>Shopify is building a financial services suite to power the Shopify economy and to meet our merchants financial needs.  As part of this initiative, we are creating proprietary machine learning algorithms to enhance underwriting capabilities for lending products like Shopify Capital and Shopify Credit. Additionally, these algorithms will bolster fraud detection and mitigation capabilities for Shopify Balance, Bill Pay, and overall risk management for our range of products and services. This work involves redefining merchant engagement with financial tools, guiding the development of machine learning models and features that will drive the next generation of financial products offered by Shopify.</p>
<p>If any of the above areas appeal we’d love to hear from you.  </p>
<p>Key outputs</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing, deploying and maintaining end-to-end machine learning systems at scale</li>
<li>Producing system design and architecture of scalable AI/ML systems</li>

<h2><strong>About The Program</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br>Our Engineering Internships are open to current university students, recent grads, self-taught learners, and career changers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Engineering Internships are 4 month long, full-time, paid experiences. For our Fall 2024 cohort, we are looking for students that can join us from September 3rd - December 20th, 2024. You must be able to commute to the Shopify Toronto office (620 King Street West).</strong> Interns will work primarily from Shopify\'s Toronto office located at 620 King Street West, while still having the opportunity to work remotely on certain days.  </p>
<p><strong>Please note: if you do not currently live in the Greater Toronto Area, you must be willing to relocate for in-office experiences.  Shopify is a digital-first company, but we\'re eager to welcome interns in-person to our office to maximize impact and learning opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>If successful in your application to the Engineering Internships Program, we will match you to a team when you start at Shopify.</p>

<p>You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100. </p>
<p>Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Path’s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold. </p>
<p><strong>The Path equations are as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AB</strong>: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>AC</strong>: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BC</strong>: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>BD</strong>: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1</p></li>
<li><p>Pathway <strong>CD</strong>: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible. </p>
<p>Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.</p>
