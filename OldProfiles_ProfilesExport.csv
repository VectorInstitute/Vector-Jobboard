I am a physician trained in Diagnostic Radiology from India and I am a resident of Canada .
Currently I am about to complete Masters by June 2024 from the Institute of Medical Sciences, at the university of Toronto in affiliation with The Hospital for sick children,Toronto

I have been doing specialised clinical research in radiology that is focused on Artificial intelligence in healthcare and diagnostic imaging since 2018. I have been familiar with Python and have a great experience in R programming software for statistical analysis.
I have a strong background and experience in Radiology- especially ultrasound and doppler in womens imaging.
I would like to connect with you to discuss about future career prospects as I believe my profile suits well with the Vector Institute Toronto

Regards,
Dr.Sayali Joshi.

I am also a graduate of the Physics option of the Engineering Science program from the University of Toronto, where I developed a strong foundation in quantum mechanics, deep learning, experimental design, and quantum algorithms.

In my first MASc research project, I independently created a scheme using differential programming in TensorFlow and careful analysis of expectation values for large discrete systems to exponentially reduce training data sizes for entanglement witnesses derived using support vector machines. These proof-of-concept results may lead to convenient measurement protocols for high dimensional discrete quantum systems which could not be easily obtained. My work is available as a preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18162 and is under review for publication at Machine Learning Science and Technology from the Institute of Physics (IOP).

I have also worked as a hardware design engineering intern at Conavi Medical, where I designed and tested electrical, optical, and mechanical hardware for a coronary artery imaging system, and trained interns and senior engineers on data acquisition and optical hardware. I am passionate about solving challenging problems at the intersection of engineering, physics, and computing, and I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to any team.",226-500-6707,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiden-rosebush/,False,False,Toronto,Ontario,,Canada,linkedin,2024-04-30T21:35:23.576Z,False,True,Studying in/Graduated from a Recognized Master's Program,No,Studying in/Graduated from a Recognized Master's Program,Fall 2024 (August - November),Mr.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiden-rosebush/,Graduate Degree (Masters)

My research philosophy is to ""build AIs for machines"": since machines and humans have different characteristics, the ways humans solve problems might not necessarily be optimal for machines.

Therefore, in the near future, I plan to study communication and cooperation among multiple models (aka agents):

- Communication among Models: I plan to learn a communication language between models that is more effective than human language (such as continuous vectors or discrete semantic representations).
- Division of labor and cooperation: Unlike the current practice of training a single all-capable large model, I plan to train a group of small specialized models with different capabilities to complete tasks through communication and cooperation.

I also work on open-source projects such as OpenNMT, Im2LaTeX, LaTeX2Im, and Steganography to make my research efforts more readily available for developers and researchers.

Mathematics and Computer Engineering Student
Queen's University (Graduating April 2024)

📚 About Me 🖥
I'm a Mathematics and Computer Engineering student at Queen's University. My academic journey is driven by a deep passion for math and a keen interest in applying it to engineering challenges.

Academic Focus:
I decided to study Mathematics and Engineering because I am interested in solving complex mathematical problems through computing and AI.

Projects:
I've worked on various software development and mathematical modeling projects, gaining hands-on experience. For example I was a part of QMIND at Queen's where I was able to work with a team of students to create a heartbeat arrhythmia detector with AI models. Another project I am proud of is the research contribution I made during my internship with the physics department which resulted in my name on a research paper.

My thesis work is to design, implement and validate a new approach to biological network integration for the purpose of identifying new subsystems of genes and proteins in the cell, thereby improving their functional characterization. I have implemented a state-of-the-art deep learning network integration algorithm called BIONIC which has been published in Nature Methods.

My interests are broad, ranging from pure machine learning research (with an emphasis on graph neural networks, neural network architecture design and reinforcement learning), to applied deep learning algorithm design and open problems in computational biology and genomics (with a focus on in silico cellular modeling). I have a strong background in mathematics and computer science as well as an appreciation for the challenges of applying machine learning models to real world data.

My research mainly focuses on the efficient inference of Transformer models for NLP applications. We propose model compression techniques such as Post-Training Quantization to compress NLP models' parameters and activations. Our main goal is to significantly reduce off-chip traffic, the main bottleneck for performance and energy consumption. To employ compressed models on edge or even in data centers, we tailor hardware accelerators capable of exploiting compact models to make inference faster and more energy-efficient.

As a graduate student of the University of Toronto, I have focused my undergraduate studies on cultivating a holistic understanding of the core principles of computer science, data analysis, and Artificial Intelligence. In addition to developing intermediate knowledge in programming languages such as Python, C, LaTeX, R Studio, and the Unity Engine, I have also bolstered my conceptual knowledge through enrolling in numerous online certification courses, including the Introduction to Business Analytics: Communicating With Data course from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as several courses on data science, Artificial Intelligence, and data analytics offered by IBM.

I have three working experiences: Independent Game Developer, Tutor, and Consulting Analyst.

In June 2021, I became an independent Game Developer to create two-dimensional platformer games using the Unity engine. This opportunity has dramatically familiarized me with tasks related to the field of computer science including bug fixing strategies, character scripting exercises, animation configurations, as well as various technical skillsets ranging from Pygame to Unreal and C#. In addition to driving my occupational objectives, these engagements have inspired me to acquire new programming language techniques, discover alternative game engines, and explore the effectiveness of different operating systems.

My research interest lies in the applications of machine learning, deep learning, and NLP, especially in healthcare, fintech, and HCI. Currently, I'm open to part-time or internship opportunities preferably in the mentioned research domains.

Previously, I worked for DeepTek Medical Imaging as a Data Scientist Assc., where I explored and researched the application of different image segmentation techniques to segment pathologies from medical radiographs. Here I got the opportunity to build a model for foreign bodies segmentation and detection for FDA approval using TensorFlow. Before working at DeepTek, I also worked at ACI Worldwide as a member of the R&D Development team where I built microservices to reduce operational costs and support business functions by integrating multiple payment gateways with existing systems.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) in 2019. I was also a vice-president at PICT ACM India Students Chapter in 2018. I am proficient in C++, Python, C#, and Java programming languages along with experience in SQL and MongoDB database systems and cutting-edge technologies like ML and DL and their applications. I continually seek to improve myself and have proven the same over the past years through my projects, skills, and experiences.

Growing up as a sci-fi movie aficionado, I was continuously intrigued by the advanced technology portrayed in them. However, with diverse professional and academic experience under my belt, this time around, I am able to comprehend the interplay of various technologies in AI, Machine Learning, and Software Industry that make these technological evolutions a possibility.

Douglas Adams' sci-fi comedy ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" transfixed me as a kid, its plot set in motion by the near-godly supercomputer Deep Thought - the powerful machine meant to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything. (After 7.5 million years, the Answer turned out to be 42.) 

Amusing though that was, the notion stuck with me, reinforced by more works of sci-fi, of powerful computers surpassing human limits to solve problems and answer questions that wield great power to reshape the world - whether for good (Charles Babbage's titular computers of ""The Difference Engine"") or for evil (the Allied Mastercomputer of ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."") The tale of Deep Thought left a second imprint on me as well: explaining its seemingly useless answer, it added that ""once you know what the Question actually is, you'll know what the Answer means."" And though this was only meant to set up the book's plot, it took on new meaning as I began studying the world of machine learning - the power of clustering, PCA, and neural networks to find answers even their creators could not conceive, raising orderly patterns from disorderly data and uncovering rules where none were known to exist.

The arc of my career has led me in pursuit of those intelligent machines, building on my fascination with math and my education in computing, tackling the world's problems once thought impossibly complicated. As part of the University of Toronto's Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) program, specializing in artificial intelligence, I'm aiming to secure an applied research internship to dive further into the details of this bold new space, especially in the field of robotics, creating machines capable of interacting with and changing even the physical world. 

Open to discussions on any interesting technical subjects and, should it suit you, Douglas Adams' novels.

Armed with a curious nature and participation in a wide range of experiences, I love to test myself with complex and ever evolving problems. This pursuit has led me accepting and offer to a Masters of Physics in Complex Systems this upcoming fall semester.
Over the past number of years, I worked as a software developer and as an undergraduate researcher and completed a college degree in audio engineering. My research has included studying “superspreader events” in the COVID-19 crisis, studying the universality of prediction markets, studying the impacts of youth programming on developmental outcomes, and researching how concealing network information from deep learning agents to reduce their ability to learn network weaknesses. These research experiences resulted in: interdisciplinary papers, receiving NSERC funding, and increasing my knowledge in the domains of information theory and machine learning.
This theme of expanding my skills through new experiences was a huge motivator in recording, mixing and mastering Sydanie’s “999,” which was long-listed for the Polaris Prize, recognizing excellence in Canadian music. Supporting Sydanie in relaying her empowering messages of young, black motherhood on this thesis of resistance was deeply rewarding.
All future experiences would be welcomed, so feel free to reach out and we can explore options over a cup of coffee.

I am broadly interested in studying “what goes into” deep models - not only data, but the broader learning environment including task design/specification, loss function, and regularization; as well as the broader societal context of deployment including privacy considerations, trends and incentives, norms, and human biases.

My advisor is Roger Melko.
My research is on the intersection between theoretical quantum many-body physics and machine learning. I apply machine learning as a computational tool to solve problems in quantum physics, and I use approaches from theoretical physics to understand deep learning. My goal is to develop a theoretical foundation of deep learning which would in turn allow to expand its applicability in physics. I am particularly interested in approaches involving information theory, statistical learning theory, and statistical physics. Several of my recent projects on the machine-learning side focus on adversarial attacks and model robustness.
Previously, I completed the Perimeter Scholars International master's program (2017), a MSc in Theoretical Physics with focus on computational approaches to quantum many-body systems (2016), and a BSc in Biophysics (2014) at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.",,,True,False,Waterloo,Ontario,,Canada,,2020-11-06T17:45:29.787Z,False,False,Post Graduate Affiliate,Yes,Post Graduate Affiliate,Already Graduated,Miss.,N/A,Postgraduate Degree (PhD)

To name a few, I had worked on a computer vision project that could automatically give attendance to students as they enter the class. I developed a robotic arm which could mimic the movements of a user wearing a sensor glove, and could perform precise movements even while at a
different location. This was meant to be useful in harmful environments, where it would be dangerous for humans to enter. This project was granted state funding.
Besides practical application, I have been extensively involved in research. In college, I published a research paper on a novel algorithm in IJCA and presented the same at NCRTIT-16 in 2016. In 2017, I
published a paper on brainwave analytics in IRJAES, and published another research paper in 2018 on Recent Trends in Multimedia and Communication in IJSRCSEIT .
I have worked as a data scientist at Dell Technologies for 2 years. I have worked on data science projects, recommendation engine systems and extensively on chatbots. I have patented a machine learning model specific to Dell's manufacturing process.

Highlights of my experience and qualifications include:
•	Team Collaboration & Problem Solver: deep interest to work on teams to help partners understand the problems more deeply and solve business challenges that requires math and statistics;  
•	Research Publications: Managed teams while working on 5+ projects with 10+ research professionals over 6 years of graduate research which lead to technical presentations in international conferences plus publications of scientific papers in peer-review journals of Physics;
•	Data Science: built efficient client risk rating models and client risk calculator tools using
Python, SQL, Spark, java and yaml software techniques; 
•	Artificial Intelligence: created many AI models that covers a big variety of business areas during the MMAI 2021 program I graduated.

iI believe that my transferable skills gained from my Data Scientist position at Scotiabank together with the business knowledge gathered at my Queen’s University MMAI degree and my Physics PhD research experience will enable me to be successful at this position.

Biomedical Engineering | Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, C#, Docker","I am a lifelong learner who strives for excellence and my passion is to innovate. My work and studies have led me to implement AI software applications using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. At The Ottawa Hospital Medical 3D Printing Laboratory I implemented multiple AI backends for medical image data manipulation. I worked closely with a front-end development team and physicians from the Medical Imaging Department to implement AI boosted software. I have more than 7 years of combined experience in data science, AI  and object-oriented programming. I am Python savvy with experience using multiple frameworks (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, PySpark to name a few) and other languages (JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, C#, Java Android, Matlab, R and C++). I am a self-motivated learner and can quickly learn other programming languages when needed. I am comfortable developing in several OS including MacOS, Windows and Linux, and I have experience with Docker. As Research Engineer I have to do many roles. I do machine learning engineering, data science, computer assisted design (CAD), 3D segmentation analysis of medical images, design of personalized medical models, polyjet 3D printing operations, and more. I value collaboration, teamwork and knowledge transfer. I learn fast from team members and I have experience mentoring, training and supervising a team. I am co-founder of Dextra Innovations, a non-for-profit that provides low-cost 3D printed devices to those in need. We also provide training, workshops and design services for those who want to develop 3D printed devices. I have many past-times such as yoga, strength training, meditation, cooking, video games, music, reading, improv/comedy, movies and off-grid camping. In the future I hope to work in a team implementing AI and data science projects in various domains.

As an accredited engineer and project management professional, I have been privileged to lead and direct people of varying discipline and background behind highly complex and time sensitive projects. My work experience encompasses a 10+ year track record, overseeing the delivery of timely, cost-effective technical solutions within various sectors including banking, oil & gas and manufacturing.
One of the projects I managed while working in the oil and gas industry was the development of a predictive equipment failure model to determine the likelihood of downhole pump failure. A data analytic tool called Spot-Fire was used to analyze downhole production data. The model was rolled out to the production department and led to a 12% reduction in operating expenses. The project exposed me to the power of data analytics and showed how imperative it is to acquire the skill set. I have since been trying to acquire more knowledge in the field of data science. 
I  have just completed a six months intensive Bootcamp in Data Analytics at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies and  currently undergoing a Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence degree(MMAI), at Queens University, with the hope of transitioning into a Data Analytic/ AI role within a Fortune 500 company within the Greater Toronto Area

Iran, helped me contribute to data science projects
in the industry. My project in Digikala, the largest Iranian eCommerce website, was Automatic Comment Filtering. Whereas,
in Cafe Bazaar, an Iranian Android marketplace, my tasks involved extracting the most important features that contribute to
selling a car by making use of car advertisement data. I also worked as a data scientist in TAPSI company which provides
the fastest growing mobile transportation platform in Iran. Doing these projects helped me transition my knowledge from
theoretical experience to real-world practice. Furthermore, teaching assistantship in Machine Learning courses helped me
develop a deep understanding of this concept and its applications. I also did my bachelor thesis in this area under the super-
vision of Prof. Shamsollahi. In this project, I used extensions of Hidden Markov Models on EEG signals to classify sleep stages
and detect sleep disorders. My thesis project is on memorability and image modifications. I leverage Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to modify the memorability of face images and objects. This project, is the most significant project that
I have ever done, which provides end-to-end solution for controlling and the modifying memorability score of different images. It helped me to broaden my knowledge in deep learning, computer vision, GPU training, and remote connecting to servers.
In my most recent job experience, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at OnsiteIQ, which aided me to gain knowledge
and experience in working with AWS. I came up with the complete plan for analyzing and structuring the AI data and writing
the scripts for data migration from Dataloop to S3 which reduces the costs significantly. Moreover, I got more comfortable

Currently looking for relevant internship and co-op opportunities in Machine Learning, Deep Learning (particularly Computer Vision) or Software Development.
For my undergrad program, I chose Intelligent Systems as my minor specialisation. As part of a coursework project, I made a fully functional application called AttendanceCam, which logs attendance of students in a classroom through facial recognition, harnessing the AI capabilities of Microsoft’s Azure platform.
It was then that I could fully comprehend the endless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. My favourite thing about AI is that it can be combined with any other field that interests me, opening up infinite permutations about what could be made. I can’t think of any other field that can be applied so pervasively. Therefore, being an astute political observer, I decided to pursue extensive research on the methods of election prediction using Machine Learning and Data Analysis. For this, working on and implementing a variety of ML algorithms gave me a more hands-on experience.
During the past year, I have been intrigued by Deep Learning. For my final semester, I wrote a research paper that compares Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques for lane following and sign recognition. For its experimental analysis, I had to implement these techniques on a Raspberry Pi car. For lane following, a widely used CNN architecture was compared to a purely Computer Vision based approach; while for sign recognition a classical CNN architecture was compared to more modern object detection algorithms such as YOLO, SSD, and R-CNN. It was exhilarating to see my project come to life during its implementation after reading a lot of papers.
I enjoy being challenged and love engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set.

I am a machine learning and back-end team lead at Atomic Reach. Atomic Reach is a content optimization platform, and that is pretty much what I do here with my team, researching user engagement and rewriting content with paraphrase and style transfer models. As you know at this point in time style transfer in  text is still a tough nut to crack, and therefore we are on top of ongoing research and constantly iterating over it, we will publish our own results soon. I recently transitioned to effectively leading the work.  We handle the production as well, therefore a fair amount of back-end work. I also perform business studies on opportunities for the business to create new features and products.
Before that I worked on Algorithmic trading, basically wrote a full backtesting and trading software in python, along with a momentum trading algorithm with end to end machine learning based tuning. Lot's of experiments, lot's of reading, and I am kind of proud that it worked out in the end as I worked in a volatile pre-seed company and had to acquire a lot of obvious knowledge about trading through outreach and reading stuff on SSRN, also the Udacity nano-degree.
I finished my masters in University of Toronto, and was accepted into the PhD program there as well, where I worked on application of deep learning in wireless communications. Did a fair amount of course on deep learning there, and still attend lectures to stay sharp. While doing my masters I worked at another Toronto startup called AdeptMind, which applied active learning in  e commerce.

He recently graduated his PhD under the supervision of prof. David Fleet in the Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, and in the Vector Institute, Toronto.
Micha has been working on machine learning, computer vision, physical inference, and optimization problems for the better part of the last decade.
In the past, he focused mainly on 3D video tracking combined with physical models.
Currently he has been focusing on representation learning, generative models, Bayesian modelling (always go Bayesian!),
and in particular the Mutual Information Machine (MIM). MIM is trained with a new symmetric variational inference,
which learns a latent representation with high mutual information, and low marginal entropy.
Importantly, MIM is not prone to suffer from posterior collapse, unlike VAEs.
If you use VAE, you might find MIM useful! I am always looking for interesting collaborations.

My primary research interest is in the area of multi-agent systems. I am interested in the issues of scale, non-stationarity, communication and sample complexity in multi-agent learning systems. As a consequence, my area of work is in the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory. I am also highly interested in theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning. I have two important and related long term research goals. The first is to bridge the widening gap between the theoretical understanding and empirical advances of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.  The second is to make multi-agent learning algorithms applicable to a variety of large-scale real-world problems. Before starting a PhD, I obtained a Master’s degree in the ECE department at the University of Waterloo, supervised by professor Mark Crowley. My bachelor's degree was in the field of Geomatics Engineering, from College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai, India. During this time I completed a Mitacs funded research internship in the Spatial lab, under the supervision of Professor Colin Robertson in Wilfrid Laurier University.  I have also worked as a research intern at Borealis AI- Edmonton and Waterloo labs. In general, my research is motivated by the field of Computational Sustainability.

During his postgraduate study at the Hong Kong university of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Nancy Ip, he has received training in biochemistry and molecular biology techniques, as well as genetics and bioinformatics. He led the first whole-genome sequencing study for AD in the Chinese population and identified AD genetic risks associated with immune pathways in the Chinese population (Zhou et.al., 2018). In addition, he demonstrated the role of non-coding AD risk in APOE nearby regions in modifying AD risk as well as APOE expression (Zhou et.al., 2019).

His recent research focuses on analyzing multi-omics data for early diagnosis and risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease and investigating its underlying pathophysiology. In particular, he has developed the first deep- learning-based polygenic risk score model for classifying AD risk based on genomic data (Zhou et.al., under review).",,,True,False,,,,,,2022-09-13T06:53:11.721Z,False,False,Unsure,Yes,Unsure,Already Graduated,Dr.,N/A,Postgraduate Degree (PhD)

I'm a member of UTSC Campus Council
https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/governance-bodies/utsc-campus-council/utsc-campus-council-membership-2020-2021
I got elected with over 500 votes which is 2 times more than any of my opponents and I have biweekly meetings with UofT staff with the topics related to the future planning of the campus, academic issues and vote for new changes. 
Additionally, I'm also a CO-Founder of Sumer.ca
https://www.sumer.ca/
My friends and I designed a grocery and COVID-19 essentials delivery website last year We mainly target the Scarborough area and I was in charge of getting a connection with senior home, University of Toronto Scarborough Campus and all the COVID-19 sections. I make calls to potential customers and visit restaurants, supermarkets, sports arena and many else. It took me a lot of effort and I ended up building cooperation with UTSC and I sold 1950 boxes of gloves two times to Home Hardware.
Lastly, I enjoy helping others and do my contribution to the community.
https://utsc.utoronto.ca/news-events/our-community/these-three-members-u-t-scarborough-community-wont-let-pandemic-stop-them-their-good
I tried my best to help the community during the COVID-19 pandemic by donating over 2000 masks and raising over $2000 for frontline medical workers. ( By contacting 4 tailors and made over 600 fabric medical hats for the frontline workers)

Afterward, I supported the establishment of a representative office of a reinsurance company in Mexico City and gave international actuarial support.
However, my desire to learn how to obtain, process, and build models out of data made me realize that I want to focus my career in data analytics. Taking this new path will let me continue to grow not only my technical skills but my interpersonal ones and be able to contribute to any industry.
I finished my Master of Data Analytics at Western Ontario in August 2020. Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at Scotiabank where my day to day activities involve extract data from the Unix servers and analyze the lending products using a customer level approach. As a result, I found myself even further drawn to use my potential to help organizations identify, attract, and retain the most profitable customers and turn their data into business insights for decision making.

I believe that while statistical and artificial intelligence tools are helpful for data analysis, they are not substitutes for critical thinking and field expertise. They simply cannot replace creativity and human ingenuity. There is where I come in, to translate statistical data into comprehensible information that is useful for decision-making.
My undergraduate education and work experience has given me a strong understanding of corporate strategy and business needs.
