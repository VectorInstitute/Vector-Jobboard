To name a few, I had worked on a computer vision project that could automatically give attendance to students as they enter the class. I developed a robotic arm which could mimic the movements of a user wearing a sensor glove, and could perform precise movements even while at a
different location. This was meant to be useful in harmful environments, where it would be dangerous for humans to enter. This project was granted state funding.
Besides practical application, I have been extensively involved in research. In college, I published a research paper on a novel algorithm in IJCA and presented the same at NCRTIT-16 in 2016. In 2017, I
published a paper on brainwave analytics in IRJAES, and published another research paper in 2018 on Recent Trends in Multimedia and Communication in IJSRCSEIT .
I have worked as a data scientist at Dell Technologies for 2 years. I have worked on data science projects, recommendation engine systems and extensively on chatbots. I have patented a machine learning model specific to Dell's manufacturing process. My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD and work on my own research in the areas of robotics, computer vision and machine learning.

My thesis work is to design, implement and validate a new approach to biological network integration for the purpose of identifying new subsystems of genes and proteins in the cell, thereby improving their functional characterization. I have implemented a state-of-the-art deep learning network integration algorithm called BIONIC which has been published in Nature Methods.

My interests are broad, ranging from pure machine learning research (with an emphasis on graph neural networks, neural network architecture design and reinforcement learning), to applied deep learning algorithm design and open problems in computational biology and genomics (with a focus on in silico cellular modeling). I have a strong background in mathematics and computer science as well as an appreciation for the challenges of applying machine learning models to real world data.

Armed with a curious nature and participation in a wide range of experiences, I love to test myself with complex and ever evolving problems. This pursuit has led me accepting and offer to a Masters of Physics in Complex Systems this upcoming fall semester.
Over the past number of years, I worked as a software developer and as an undergraduate researcher and completed a college degree in audio engineering. My research has included studying “superspreader events” in the COVID-19 crisis, studying the universality of prediction markets, studying the impacts of youth programming on developmental outcomes, and researching how concealing network information from deep learning agents to reduce their ability to learn network weaknesses. These research experiences resulted in: interdisciplinary papers, receiving NSERC funding, and increasing my knowledge in the domains of information theory and machine learning.
This theme of expanding my skills through new experiences was a huge motivator in recording, mixing and mastering Sydanie’s “999,” which was long-listed for the Polaris Prize, recognizing excellence in Canadian music. Supporting Sydanie in relaying her empowering messages of young, black motherhood on this thesis of resistance was deeply rewarding.
All future experiences would be welcomed, so feel free to reach out and we can explore options over a cup of coffee.

My research is on the intersection between theoretical quantum many-body physics and machine learning. I apply machine learning as a computational tool to solve problems in quantum physics, and I use approaches from theoretical physics to understand deep learning. My goal is to develop a theoretical foundation of deep learning which would in turn allow to expand its applicability in physics. I am particularly interested in approaches involving information theory, statistical learning theory, and statistical physics. Several of my recent projects on the machine-learning side focus on adversarial attacks and model robustness.

Why? I wanted to see real life robots, obviously! 

Robots from that time have changed drastically. From the first time that Cleverbot popped up on the internet, I was so intrigued by how it worked. I even did a research project for Computer Science class on it. Once I figured out how it did, my passion for AI bloomed. I shot for the stars and landed somewhere in IT. Not too shabby, right? I mean, in that time I was able to discover my passion, learning. I loved learning so much that I wanted to share it with others by teaching. Whether it be kids or colleagues, machines naturally seemed like the next step.

That worked for a while but then the opportunity of my dreams came along, user-friendly AI applications. My good friend (IBM) Watson has taken me a long way. Through a course in my IT program to a job opportunity with my school, all the way to a Master's degree in Business and AI. I have learned so much in this time, practical and theoretical.

Douglas Adams' sci-fi comedy ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" transfixed me as a kid, its plot set in motion by the near-godly supercomputer Deep Thought - the powerful machine meant to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything. (After 7.5 million years, the Answer turned out to be 42.) 

Amusing though that was, the notion stuck with me, reinforced by more works of sci-fi, of powerful computers surpassing human limits to solve problems and answer questions that wield great power to reshape the world - whether for good (Charles Babbage's titular computers of ""The Difference Engine"") or for evil (the Allied Mastercomputer of ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."") The tale of Deep Thought left a second imprint on me as well: explaining its seemingly useless answer, it added that ""once you know what the Question actually is, you'll know what the Answer means."" And though this was only meant to set up the book's plot, it took on new meaning as I began studying the world of machine learning - the power of clustering, PCA, and neural networks to find answers even their creators could not conceive, raising orderly patterns from disorderly data and uncovering rules where none were known to exist.

The arc of my career has led me in pursuit of those intelligent machines, building on my fascination with math and my education in computing, tackling the world's problems once thought impossibly complicated. As part of the University of Toronto's Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) program, specializing in artificial intelligence, I'm aiming to secure an applied research internship to dive further into the details of this bold new space, especially in the field of robotics, creating machines capable of interacting with and changing even the physical world. 

Open to discussions on any interesting technical subjects and, should it suit you, Douglas Adams' novels.

Currently looking for relevant internship and co-op opportunities in Machine Learning, Deep Learning (particularly Computer Vision) or Software Development.
For my undergrad program, I chose Intelligent Systems as my minor specialisation. As part of a coursework project, I made a fully functional application called AttendanceCam, which logs attendance of students in a classroom through facial recognition, harnessing the AI capabilities of Microsoft’s Azure platform.
It was then that I could fully comprehend the endless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. My favourite thing about AI is that it can be combined with any other field that interests me, opening up infinite permutations about what could be made. I can’t think of any other field that can be applied so pervasively. Therefore, being an astute political observer, I decided to pursue extensive research on the methods of election prediction using Machine Learning and Data Analysis. For this, working on and implementing a variety of ML algorithms gave me a more hands-on experience.
During the past year, I have been intrigued by Deep Learning. For my final semester, I wrote a research paper that compares Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques for lane following and sign recognition. For its experimental analysis, I had to implement these techniques on a Raspberry Pi car. For lane following, a widely used CNN architecture was compared to a purely Computer Vision based approach; while for sign recognition a classical CNN architecture was compared to more modern object detection algorithms such as YOLO, SSD, and R-CNN. It was exhilarating to see my project come to life during its implementation after reading a lot of papers.
I enjoy being challenged and love engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set.

He recently graduated his PhD under the supervision of prof. David Fleet in the Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, and in the Vector Institute, Toronto.
Micha has been working on machine learning, computer vision, physical inference, and optimization problems for the better part of the last decade.
In the past, he focused mainly on 3D video tracking combined with physical models.
Currently he has been focusing on representation learning, generative models, Bayesian modelling (always go Bayesian!),
and in particular the Mutual Information Machine (MIM). MIM is trained with a new symmetric variational inference,
which learns a latent representation with high mutual information, and low marginal entropy.
Importantly, MIM is not prone to suffer from posterior collapse, unlike VAEs.
If you use VAE, you might find MIM useful! I am always looking for interesting collaborations.

I am a machine learning and back-end team lead at Atomic Reach. Atomic Reach is a content optimization platform, and that is pretty much what I do here with my team, researching user engagement and rewriting content with paraphrase and style transfer models. As you know at this point in time style transfer in  text is still a tough nut to crack, and therefore we are on top of ongoing research and constantly iterating over it, we will publish our own results soon. I recently transitioned to effectively leading the work.  We handle the production as well, therefore a fair amount of back-end work. I also perform business studies on opportunities for the business to create new features and products.
Before that I worked on Algorithmic trading, basically wrote a full backtesting and trading software in python, along with a momentum trading algorithm with end to end machine learning based tuning. Lot's of experiments, lot's of reading, and I am kind of proud that it worked out in the end as I worked in a volatile pre-seed company and had to acquire a lot of obvious knowledge about trading through outreach and reading stuff on SSRN, also the Udacity nano-degree.
I finished my masters in University of Toronto, and was accepted into the PhD program there as well, where I worked on application of deep learning in wireless communications.

I have been recently a Machine Learning (focused in Interpretability) Software Engineer intern at Facebook, and previously a Product Manager, where I have successfully developed interpersonal and multidisciplinary skills, interacting with more than 10 different teams in product, sales, customer services, and technology, having learned how to establish partnerships across multi-functional areas.
Before, I was developing code in C and C++.
In 2016, I have decided to get a more formal education by applying for a Ph.D. in AI, with the main focus on Machine Learning Interpretability. I am now in the 5th year of this Ph.D. program.

Last April I began working for Queen's University as an NLP Intern, where I have had the opportunity to apply these concepts to real world problems. In this role I was able to derive leading insights pertaining to diagnosing emotion behind human/chatbot interactions.
In addition to my strong technical skills and work experience I have strong soft skills. I am highly driven, a strong communicator, and excel when given responsibility in leadership roles.

My research interests are lossless data compression, information theory, and AI. Data sources usually have some type of structure, such as graphs and sets. This means we can compress them better by taking this structure into account during compression. Unfortunately, existing methods that do this are either sub-optimal (don’t achieve the Shannon bound) or computationally intractable. I’m interested in building computationally efficient compression algorithms that can be used with deep generative models on structured data, as well as their connections to bayesian methods.

As a graduate student of the University of Toronto, I have focused my undergraduate studies on cultivating a holistic understanding of the core principles of computer science, data analysis, and Artificial Intelligence. In addition to developing intermediate knowledge in programming languages such as Python, C, LaTeX, R Studio, and the Unity Engine, I have also bolstered my conceptual knowledge through enrolling in numerous online certification courses, including the Introduction to Business Analytics: Communicating With Data course from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as several courses on data science, Artificial Intelligence, and data analytics offered by IBM.

I have three working experiences: Independent Game Developer, Tutor, and Consulting Analyst.

In June 2021, I became an independent Game Developer to create two-dimensional platformer games using the Unity engine. This opportunity has dramatically familiarized me with tasks related to the field of computer science including bug fixing strategies, character scripting exercises, animation configurations, as well as various technical skillsets ranging from Pygame to Unreal and C#. In addition to driving my occupational objectives, these engagements have inspired me to acquire new programming language techniques, discover alternative game engines, and explore the effectiveness of different operating systems.

My primary research interest is in the area of multi-agent systems. I am interested in the issues of scale, non-stationarity, communication and sample complexity in multi-agent learning systems. As a consequence, my area of work is in the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory. I am also highly interested in theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning. I have two important and related long term research goals. The first is to bridge the widening gap between the theoretical understanding and empirical advances of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.  The second is to make multi-agent learning algorithms applicable to a variety of large-scale real-world problems. Before starting a PhD, I obtained a Master’s degree in the ECE department at the University of Waterloo, supervised by professor Mark Crowley. My bachelor's degree was in the field of Geomatics Engineering, from College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai, India. During this time I completed a Mitacs funded research internship in the Spatial lab, under the supervision of Professor Colin Robertson in Wilfrid Laurier University.

I am broadly interested in studying “what goes into” deep models - not only data, but the broader learning environment including task design/specification, loss function, and regularization; as well as the broader societal context of deployment including privacy considerations, trends and incentives, norms, and human biases.

As an accredited engineer and project management professional, I have been privileged to lead and direct people of varying discipline and background behind highly complex and time sensitive projects. My work experience encompasses a 10+ year track record, overseeing the delivery of timely, cost-effective technical solutions within various sectors including banking, oil & gas and manufacturing.
One of the projects I managed while working in the oil and gas industry was the development of a predictive equipment failure model to determine the likelihood of downhole pump failure. A data analytic tool called Spot-Fire was used to analyze downhole production data. The model was rolled out to the production department and led to a 12% reduction in operating expenses. The project exposed me to the power of data analytics and showed how imperative it is to acquire the skill set. I have since been trying to acquire more knowledge in the field of data science. 
I  have just completed a six months intensive Bootcamp in Data Analytics at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies and  currently undergoing a Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence degree(MMAI), at Queens University, with the hope of transitioning into a Data Analytic/ AI role within a Fortune 500 company within the Greater Toronto Area

Gomes Ferreira,https://talenthub.vectorinstitute.ai/profiles/2078124/view_image/20200614_205816_2.jpg,,"I am a PhD in Theoretical Physics with 8 years of research experience which resulted in the publication of scientific articles in high circulation journals. Recently, an Anti-Money Laundering Data Scientist at Scotiabank and a Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence from Queen's University with strong technical and conversational skills who have managed several AI team projects of large industrial interests related to finance, marketing, investment increasing, consulting and technology development.
Highlights of my experience and qualifications include:
•	Team Collaboration & Problem Solver: deep interest to work on teams to help partners understand the problems more deeply and solve business challenges that requires math and statistics;  
•	Research Publications: Managed teams while working on 5+ projects with 10+ research professionals over 6 years of graduate research which lead to technical presentations in international conferences plus publications of scientific papers in peer-review journals of Physics;
•	Data Science: built efficient client risk rating models and client risk calculator tools using
Python, SQL, Spark, java and yaml software techniques; 
•	Artificial Intelligence: created many AI models that covers a big variety of business areas during the MMAI 2021 program I graduated.

iI believe that my transferable skills gained from my Data Scientist position at Scotiabank together with the business knowledge gathered at my Queen’s University MMAI degree and my Physics PhD research experience will enable me to be successful at this position. 

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to speaking with you.

During this I have worked with both clinicians and researchers on developing novel tools to aid clinicians in quantifying vertebral stability of metastatically involved vertebrae. 

My current work is to quantify and predict vertebral stability of metastatically involved vertebrae using Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and 3D CT scans. These metastatically involved vertebrae are treated with Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), a highly focused form of radiation treatment. However, a side effect is that it can cause nontraumatic vertebral fracture. Using CNNs, features can be extracted from the 3D CT images of the vertebra and overall spine to determine if a vertebra will undergo fracture. 

Through this work I have gained extensive knowledge of Python API’s for A.I. and deep learning (Numpy, Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.), as well as experience specific in medical imaging API’s (SimpleITK). To accommodate the large 3D images I also have experience with multiprocessing in Python. 

This work in A.I. and deep learning was achievable with the background with physics, mathematics and engineering from both my undergraduate and Master’s degrees. They provided me the fundamental knowledge necessary to tackle and adapt to the growing complex challenges facing society today. These degrees focused on mathematical modelling and required the ability to learn and grasp a variety of topics. This has allowed me to quickly learn new topics and skills and to apply them to real world scenarios.

Iran, helped me contribute to data science projects
in the industry. My project in Digikala, the largest Iranian eCommerce website, was Automatic Comment Filtering. Whereas,
in Cafe Bazaar, an Iranian Android marketplace, my tasks involved extracting the most important features that contribute to
selling a car by making use of car advertisement data. I also worked as a data scientist in TAPSI company which provides
the fastest growing mobile transportation platform in Iran. Doing these projects helped me transition my knowledge from
theoretical experience to real-world practice. Furthermore, teaching assistantship in Machine Learning courses helped me
develop a deep understanding of this concept and its applications. I also did my bachelor thesis in this area under the super-
vision of Prof. Shamsollahi. In this project, I used extensions of Hidden Markov Models on EEG signals to classify sleep stages
and detect sleep disorders. My thesis project is on memorability and image modifications. I leverage Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to modify the memorability of face images and objects. This project, is the most significant project that
I have ever done, which provides end-to-end solution for controlling and the modifying memorability score of different images. It helped me to broaden my knowledge in deep learning, computer vision, GPU training, and remote connecting to servers.
In my most recent job experience, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at OnsiteIQ, which aided me to gain knowledge
and experience in working with AWS. I came up with the complete plan for analyzing and structuring the AI data and writing
the scripts for data migration from Dataloop to S3 which reduces the costs significantly. Moreover, I got more comfortable
with Docker and containers by optimizing the AI base image from AWS TF 2.9.1 image.",5192818406,,https://github.com/mamyou96,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-younesi/,,False,False,https://canadaai.jobboard.io/api/v1/profiles/b7e02440-b141-4cb7-ae7c-020bd63fc3b3/resume,London,Ontario,,Canada,,2020-05-27T22:34:50.530Z,2022-11-18T15:32:22.944Z,True,True,Vector Scholarship Recipient,Yes,Vector Scholarship Recipient,Ontario,Already Graduated,,Mr.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-younesi/,,Graduate Degree (Masters),Entry Level (0-2 Years),Artificial Intelligence,"Education, Financial Services, Health, Professional Services (e.g Consulting), Public Administration (i.e Gov't), Retail, Software, Technology (Information and Media), Technology (Product Development), Telecommunications, Transportation",Full Time,"Business Analyst/Business Intelligence Analyst , Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Machine Learning Researcher/Scientist ",Western University,True,True,True,True

I'm co-supervised by Prof. Florian Shkurti and Prof. Tim Barfoot. My research is generously funded by the CGS-M Scholarships and the Vector Scholarship in AI.

The goal of my research is to improve robot's ability to model uncertain environments and make plans for complex and long-horizon tasks. Towards this end, I am currently working on planning algorithms for autonomous surface vessel (ASV) in Canadian lakes. Before that, I have also also explored continual learning in learning dynamics model for control.

I have also been fortunate to work under many fantastic researchers in robotics. Previously, I collabrated with Prof. Fabio Ramos from Nvidia and on task and motion planning. In undergrad, I was involved in the student design team aUToronto, where we competed and won the SAE Autodrive Challenge.

I've worked on a variety of topics in the past 3 years, and the encompassing theme is ""robust decision-making with (learned) models"".  These days, my main research interest is in offline model-based reinforcement learning.

My friends and I designed a grocery and COVID-19 essentials delivery website last year We mainly target the Scarborough area and I was in charge of getting a connection with senior home, University of Toronto Scarborough Campus and all the COVID-19 sections. I make calls to potential customers and visit restaurants, supermarkets, sports arena and many else. It took me a lot of effort and I ended up building cooperation with UTSC and I sold 1950 boxes of gloves two times to Home Hardware.
Lastly, I enjoy helping others and do my contribution to the community.

During his postgraduate study at the Hong Kong university of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Nancy Ip, he has received training in biochemistry and molecular biology techniques, as well as genetics and bioinformatics. He led the first whole-genome sequencing study for AD in the Chinese population and identified AD genetic risks associated with immune pathways in the Chinese population (Zhou et.al., 2018). In addition, he demonstrated the role of non-coding AD risk in APOE nearby regions in modifying AD risk as well as APOE expression (Zhou et.al., 2019).

His recent research focuses on analyzing multi-omics data for early diagnosis and risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease and investigating its underlying pathophysiology. In particular, he has developed the first deep- learning-based polygenic risk score model for classifying AD risk based on genomic data (Zhou et.al., under review).",,,https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=fred-xiaopu-zhou-xpzhou,,,fredzhou91,False,False,https://canadaai.jobboard.io/api/v1/profiles/c87abef9-453d-47d6-9a96-c9fde3109246/resume,,,,,,2022-09-13T06:53:11.679Z,2022-09-13T06:53:11.721Z,True,True,Unaffiliated PhD Graduate/Candidate,Yes,Unsure,,Already Graduated,I'm seeking for opportunity for conducting research in AI+genomics field,Dr.,N/A,,Postgraduate Degree (PhD),Senior Level (5+ Years),PhD in Life Science,Health,"Full Time, Contract","Data Scientist, Machine Learning Researcher/Scientist ",Other,True,True,True,True
