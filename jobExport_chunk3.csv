<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Overview:</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">“Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>What Are We Looking For?</b></span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented leaders who are equally at home amongst neural networks as they are translating complex issues into concise communications and directions. We want advanced analysts / data scientists who come armed with not only strong statistical, programming and data engineering skills but also a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right the first time and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">To be a Director in Retail and Small Business Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you have to want to be an owner who embraces both the accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”) and responsibilities that come with ownership. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs (for accurate optimized forecasts) and questions (qualitative and analytic alike) into outcomes and answers, exploring both novel and legacy data sets / methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that you “own” will all be equally important. The types of Directors we are looking for are player-coaches (an interest in teaching & mentoring is essential!) who relish the idea of running their own “model factory” and everything that comes with it.</span></span></p>
<p><br><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;""><b>Make an Impact</b></span></span><br> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">As a director, you will report directly to the VP of Retail and Small Business Models and Analytics and be a critical member of the global leadership team. You will be accountable for – from conception through execution and governance – the capital estimation, optimization and forecasting models covering The Bank’s retail and small business product lines. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Operations, Capital Management, Provisioning, Product, Risk Strategy & Risk Management, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Legal, Compliance and Audit.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">Your team will have access to both traditional SAS tools / SQL databases / Hadoop clusters and a modern machine learning stack that includes both public and on-premise private cloud computing, open source Jupyter development environments, and data visualization business intelligence tools.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16.0px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif;"">Under your guidance, your team of risk modeling and business analysis experts will use these tools to develop and run advanced risk prediction and forecasting models that will be used to help manage tens of $billions of capital and exposures, every day and therefore need to be not only accurate and precise, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful. You will be responsible for setting priorities, leading by example, getting deep-in-the-weeds, coaching, mentoring and ultimately, delivering results.</span></span></p>

<h2>About the job</h2>
<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.</p>

This has consistently allowed us to achieve industry-leading accuracy and reliability. We build lightweight, cost-effective, edge solutions: we locate compute nodes close to the sensors (as opposed to in the cloud) and leverage distributed compute and wireless transmission where needed. </p>

<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p><strong>What is the opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>Global Risk Analytics (GRA) is the center of expertise for models used in risk management. This includes risk analytics for market risk, counterparty credit risk and emerging risk. GRA’s analytics innovation team focuses on emerging risks, including machine learning and climate analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the large size of market data, data analytics (e.g., using advanced techniques such as machine learning) are needed to provide business insights. In addition, having an intelligent data visualization platform would bring the analytical presentation to the next level. As a result, GRA is developing a Dashboard web application for this purpose. This web application would serve as a centralized platform to host various data analytics dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further, due to increasing importance of assessing the impacts of climate change to financial institutions, GRA is also building expertise in climate risk analytics to support RBC’s various climate risk stress testing and scenario analysis mandates (e.g., CCAR in US, ICAAP in UK). In particular, GRA has the model development ownership for several regional climate risk scenario analysis models, covering both transition risk (posed to clients in transition to low-carbon economy) and physical risk (posed by acute weather events) for different asset classes (e.g., corporate bond, municipal bonds, real estate, and wholesale loans). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Climate analytics is an emerging field. Institutions around the world (e.g., regulators, banks, vendors, etc.) are grappling with the challenges in how to enhance the data, scenario design, and methodology. At this stage, GRA is currently developing a unified platform to onboard different “climate risk + machine learning” modules, and potentially utilizing open-source data (if deemed appropriate) for research purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GRA is seeking an individual who is interested in applying data analytics (including machine learning) and programming skills to empower our climate risk analytics capability. The intern student will be involved in researching open-source data platforms for climate risk, and developing Python-based tools for climate risk related analytics and machine learning applications. The candidate will learn data analytics and machine learning with applications in climate risk.</p>

<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Who are we?</b></div>
<div>We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learns to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We've recently raised our <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://txt.cohere.com/announcement/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Series C</a>, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">“Attention is all you need”</a>, and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Why this role? </b></div>
<div>At Cohere, we strive to continually improve our large language models. Academic research and real-world experience has demonstrated that high quality, diverse datasets can contribute as much to the performance and capabilities of LLMs as the underlying model architecture and training regimen. We at Cohere believe data will play a central role in accelerating the advancement of our already world-class language models.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Data is therefore critical to our success. Our ability to acquire data that is accurate, relevant, and timely is key to our ability to improve the quality of our models. We strive to continuously improve our data acquisition processes and systems to ensure that we have the data we need to stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers. We run frequent experiments to learn more about the role of data for model quality, from data mixtures, to cleaning techniques, to quality control.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This role will be part of the Data Acquisition team, which broadly provides data for training models and is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that acquires, cleans, and formats data for model training. We are looking for a technically skilled, resourceful problem-solver who is able to work in areas of ambiguity and find efficient and sometimes creative solutions. The main responsibility of this role is to improve our internal data acquisition infrastructure, which includes data crawlers, formatters, and integrations with data providers. This role would also work closely with different teams at Cohere to support their data acquisition needs, as well as engage in more experimental work to develop highly informative data signals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
