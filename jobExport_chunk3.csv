<p>The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.<br></p>
<p>The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don\'t always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.</p>
<p>Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world\'s fast-paced business needs.</p>

<p><strong>What is the opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>Global Risk Analytics (GRA) is the center of expertise for models used in risk management. This includes risk analytics for market risk, counterparty credit risk and emerging risk. GRA’s analytics innovation team focuses on emerging risks, including machine learning and climate analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the large size of market data, data analytics (e.g., using advanced techniques such as machine learning) are needed to provide business insights. In addition, having an intelligent data visualization platform would bring the analytical presentation to the next level. As a result, GRA is developing a Dashboard web application for this purpose. This web application would serve as a centralized platform to host various data analytics dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further, due to increasing importance of assessing the impacts of climate change to financial institutions, GRA is also building expertise in climate risk analytics to support RBC’s various climate risk stress testing and scenario analysis mandates (e.g., CCAR in US, ICAAP in UK). In particular, GRA has the model development ownership for several regional climate risk scenario analysis models, covering both transition risk (posed to clients in transition to low-carbon economy) and physical risk (posed by acute weather events) for different asset classes (e.g., corporate bond, municipal bonds, real estate, and wholesale loans). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Climate analytics is an emerging field. Institutions around the world (e.g., regulators, banks, vendors, etc.) are grappling with the challenges in how to enhance the data, scenario design, and methodology. At this stage, GRA is currently developing a unified platform to onboard different “climate risk + machine learning” modules, and potentially utilizing open-source data (if deemed appropriate) for research purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GRA is seeking an individual who is interested in applying data analytics (including machine learning) and programming skills to empower our climate risk analytics capability. The intern student will be involved in researching open-source data platforms for climate risk, and developing Python-based tools for climate risk related analytics and machine learning applications. The candidate will learn data analytics and machine learning with applications in climate risk.</p>

<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Who are we?</b></div>
<div>We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learns to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We've recently raised our <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://txt.cohere.com/announcement/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Series C</a>, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">“Attention is all you need”</a>, and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b style=""font-size:18px;"">Why this role? </b></div>
<div>At Cohere, we strive to continually improve our large language models. Academic research and real-world experience has demonstrated that high quality, diverse datasets can contribute as much to the performance and capabilities of LLMs as the underlying model architecture and training regimen. We at Cohere believe data will play a central role in accelerating the advancement of our already world-class language models.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Data is therefore critical to our success. Our ability to acquire data that is accurate, relevant, and timely is key to our ability to improve the quality of our models. We strive to continuously improve our data acquisition processes and systems to ensure that we have the data we need to stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers. We run frequent experiments to learn more about the role of data for model quality, from data mixtures, to cleaning techniques, to quality control.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This role will be part of the Data Acquisition team, which broadly provides data for training models and is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that acquires, cleans, and formats data for model training. We are looking for a technically skilled, resourceful problem-solver who is able to work in areas of ambiguity and find efficient and sometimes creative solutions. The main responsibility of this role is to improve our internal data acquisition infrastructure, which includes data crawlers, formatters, and integrations with data providers. This role would also work closely with different teams at Cohere to support their data acquisition needs, as well as engage in more experimental work to develop highly informative data signals.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<b>Please Note</b>: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.</div>

<li>Run experiments using new data inputs, preprocessing techniques, and data mixtures</li>
</ul></ul>

<li>You have more than 2 years of experience working on a software or machine learning engineering team</li>
<li>You have proficiency in Python and have used distributed processing technologies like Spark, Dask, etc.</li>
<li>You have experience building data pipelines and ETL processes for large-scale datasets</li>
<li>You have experience working with unstructured and/or human-annotated data (e.g., collecting or assessing sample quality).</li>
<li>You have experience with ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR</li>
<li>You have strong communication and problem-solving skills, preferring the right tool for the job even if it’s outside your wheelhouse</li>
<li>You feel comfortable actively reading academic literature and researching state-of-the-art NLP best practices.</li>
<li>You have a demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products</li>
</ul></ul>
